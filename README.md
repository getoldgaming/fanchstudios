# Fanch Studios â€” Vue 3 clone

This repository is a small Vue 3 + Vite starter that mimics the structure of a photography homepage (navbar, hero, gallery, about, contact, footer).

Getting started

1. Install dependencies:

```powershell
cd "h:\new site"; npm install
```

2. Run dev server:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

Notes
- Sample images are not included. Add four images named `sample-1.jpg`..`sample-4.jpg` into `src/images`.
- This is a layout-focused clone for learning and iteration. Replace copy, colors, and images to match the real site.
