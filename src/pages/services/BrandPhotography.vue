    <h2>Brand Photography</h2>
    <p>
      Memorable brand photography helps small businesses and startups in Cincinnati show who they are—quickly. I plan and shoot
      images you can use across your website, social media, ads, and pitch decks. Whether you’re opening a cafe in Over-the-Rhine,
      launching a DTC product from Covington, or refreshing your About page, I focus on clean lighting, real moments, and
      consistent color so your brand feels trustworthy and current.
